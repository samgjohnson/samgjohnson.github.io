<p>(Updated 2023) I offer private tutoring and independent classes with individuals and small groups. My private classes offer an accelerated and individualized pathway to increased fluency. I use task-based and communictivate methods that will get jump start your speaking, reading, listeing, and writing skills. I build on my decade of classroom experience to create custom curriculum using real materials from diverse web-based sources. I conduct classes via Google Meet or Zoom and offer flexible scheduling to meet your needs. Throughout my career in education, I have always worked with individuals via language exchange or paid tutoring and classes. My independent contract work allows me to explore new materials and methods, meet new people, and - above all - share my love of language education with a broader public. </p>
