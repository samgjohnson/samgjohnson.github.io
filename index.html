	    <h3>Samuel G Johnson, PhD Student, University of Miami</h3>
    			<body><p>I include my middle initial because there are many other Sam Johnson's who are a bit more famous than me... In the sections of this professional profile page you will find my teaching portfolio, some research materials, and my CV. Please feel free to contact me with any inquiries using the email link at the end of this page. This site is very much a work in progress, so please pardon the lack of polish, images, interactivity that you may expect from a web page. It is a siimple static website that I built myself to connect my professional life across social media, publications, and projects. For now, thank you for taking the time to visit my site!</p></body>
