<p>*Indios, or Indians, while used by some peoples and social movements to refer to Indigenous, First-Nations, or Aborigianl poeples in the Americas, can also be pejorative. I use it here to draw attention to the stereotypical representations that dominate the pieces included in this project.</p>
<p>The brief Google slides presentaiton was prepared in the Fall 2018 semester for a DH course at the University of Miami. It is an initial step in larger project! In this presentation I consider the representation of indigenous peoples in the age of clickbait links and viral news stories. I use text analysis to consider a small archive of short-form, viral articles from various news outlets to consider their role in maintaning Western imaginaries of indigenous peoples as either "dead" civilizations or distant minoritarian populutions that are to soon dissappear. My critique draws on decolonial theory and media criticsm to consider the shortcomings and vast room for improvement in media representaitons of indigenous populations globally. Please contact me with any opportunities for collaboration or recommendations for future research directions!</p>
