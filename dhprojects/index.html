<h2>Works in Progress</h2>
<p>I the projeect below, I consider the representation of indigenous peoples in the age of clickbait links and viral news stories. I use text analysis to consider a small archive of short-form viral articles from various news outlets to consider their role in maintaning Western imaginaries of indigenous peoples as either "dead" civilizations or distant minoritarian populutions that are to soon dissappear. My critique draws on decolonial theory and media criticsm to consider the shortcomings and vast room for improvement in media representaitons of indigenous populations globally. Please contact me with any opportunities for collaboration or recommendations for future research directions!</p>

<p>*Indios, or Indians, while used by some peoples and social movements, can also be pejorative. I use it here to draw attention to the stereotypical representations that dominate the pieces included in this project.</p>
