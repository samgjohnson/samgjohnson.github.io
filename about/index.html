<h3>About Me </h3>
<img src="/assets/sjohnson-headshot.jpg" align="left" style="padding: 0px 20px 0px 0px; width:300px;height:298px"><p>Thank you for visiting my teaching and professional profile. My name is Sam Johnson and I am currently the Department Chair of Language and Culture Studies and Spanish Faculty at St. Andrew's Sewanee School on the Cumberland Plateau in Sewanee, TN. I also teach Spanish part time at the University of the South (aka Sewanee). I have a PhD Candidate in Literary, Language, and Cultural Studies from the University of Miami (UM) where I studied in the Department of Modern Languages. I also have completed Master's degrees in Latin American Studies, Spanish, and Portuguese at the University of New Mexico (UNM). In my career, I have taught courses in Spanish and Portuguese Language instruction, Latin American Cultural Studies, and Film and Media studies. </p>
<p>I received my B.A. in Spanish and History from Aquinas College in Grand Rapids, MI. While pursuing my undergraduate degree I was able to spend semesters in Spain and Costa Rica, acquiring a passion for the Spanish language, Latin American history and culture, and international education. While at UNM, I served as a TA in Ecuador, coordinated online classes, and was supported by the Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) fellowship to study Portuguese and travel to Brazil. At UM my attention turned towards the the representations of extractivism, the environment, and climate change in Latin American cultural production and their intersections with race, social class, and (de)colonial theory. My dissertation, "Amazonian Transmedia: Seeking Epistemic and Ecological Justice in the Anthropocece" traces these themes through lenses of Amazonian Studies, Indigigenous Media, and Environmental sciences to examine extractive practices, environmentalisms, and their representaiton across media formats.</p>
<p> During the completion of my post-secondary degrees, I have learned not only a passion for my education but for the education of others. In the following pages please find original teaching materials developed for Spanish as a second language courses, digital humanities projects, select publications, as well as my CV.
